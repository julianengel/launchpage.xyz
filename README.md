# launchpage.xyz

launchpage.xyz is a very simplistic, small and resposive landing page, can be deployed to Netlify or Github Pages to serve as a temporary site until the main site becomes available.  
It was created because Facebook blocked 2 of my urls while they were registered but didn't have a site connected to them. (GoDaddy showed ads on the parking site, and FB deemed it as spam against Community standards). To avoid getting blocked, any new domain I register I point here. 

## Installation

If using **Netlify**, simply fork and upload. 

If using **GHPages**, change where the form gets submitted to. 

## Usage

Plug and Play Solution. The form automatically marks which site registered the emai by grabbing the domain and submitting it as hidden field on the form.
